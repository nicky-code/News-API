## Description
This project was generated with PYTHON version 3.6
I install the flask with this command python3.6 -m pip install flask to illustrates how to download the framework.
I also install the bootstrap to help me for the styling.

## Code scaffolding
Run python3.6 manage.py server when you want to implement the features we have just have been testing.

## Running unittests
Run python3.6 plus test file where you are adding the test function.

## BDD
### Behaviour
We want our application to:

1. we want that our user to see various news sources on the homepage of the application.
2. User would also select news source and see all news articles from the selected news source in the application.
3. User would be able to see the image,description and time a news article was created.
4. User would want to click on an article and read the full article on the source website.
